# 🃏 Blackjack Game  

A simple command-line **Blackjack** game built using **Python**. The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack and allows a user to play against a computer dealer.

## 🚀 How to Play  
1. Run the script and choose whether to start a new game.  
2. You and the computer dealer receive two initial cards.  
3. You can **hit** (draw another card) or **stand** (keep your hand).  
4. The computer draws cards until it reaches a minimum score of 17.  
5. The winner is determined based on the standard **Blackjack** rules:
   - If your total score **exceeds 21**, you lose.
   - If you hit **21**, you win instantly unless the dealer also has 21 (push).  
   - The closest score to **21** without exceeding wins.
